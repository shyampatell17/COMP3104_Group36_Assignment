# About DevOps #

The primary goal of DevOps is to streamline and automate the application lifecycle to accelerate the delivery of high-quality products.
DevOps is a combination of software development (dev) and operations (ops).
DevOps engineers will instead spend time setting up for the automated build, testing, and deployment.
